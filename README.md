<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="40px" />, I'm Keshav</h1>
<h3 align="center">Software Engineer @ Visible Alpha</h3>

I am passionate about solving complex problems and taking on new challenges that make a lasting impact on people's everyday lives. I am a problem solver, I'll recognize the most important problems around, and wear whatever hat I need to solve those problems. I believe in teamwork and producing results by applying full dedication to everything I do.

My key area of interest lies in Data Structures and Algorithms and Software Engineering. 
My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, software design, database design. I am also a 4 â˜† coder on CodeChef 

Through my graduate studies at KJ Somaiya, by participating in multiple hackathons, coding competitions, and my work experiences, I have had a chance to effectively work and understand the perspective of individuals from different backgrounds and cultures. I am forever captivated by how technology can continuously improve our lives yet still ceaselessly reveal areas for improvement. 

There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
